## User

Hello!

## Assistant

Now that I've reviewed the main parts of the codebase, I understand the key components and architecture of StreetRaceðŸš—ðŸ’¨. Let me provide a comprehensive summary of my findings:

# StreetRaceðŸš—ðŸ’¨ Project Analysis

## Core Architecture

StreetRaceðŸš—ðŸ’¨ is an agentic AI coding partner designed to help engineers leverage AI capabilities directly from the command line. It follows a clean, modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Main Entry Point** (`main.py`): Configures and runs the application, handling user input/output and errors.

2. **Application Orchestration** (`app.py`): Central coordinator managing the application flow and component interactions.

3. **LLM Interface** (`llm_interface.py`): Abstraction layer for communicating with different AI models through litellm, with built-in retry logic for error handling.

4. **Workflow Supervision** (`workflow/supervisor.py`): Implements the ReAct agent pattern and manages the interaction cycle between user and AI.

5. **Session Management** (`session_service.py`): Persists conversation context between runs, supporting multiple sessions for different projects.

6. **Tools** (`tools/`): Implements file system operations and CLI tools that the AI can use, with clear separation between tool definitions and implementations.

7. **UI Components** (`ui/`): Console-based user interface with event handling through a UI bus.

8. **Command Handling** (`commands/`): Processes internal commands like `/help`, `/exit`, etc.

## Key Patterns and Principles

1. **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation between UI, business logic, and tools.

2. **Dependency Injection**: Components receive their dependencies through constructors.

3. **Event-Driven Design**: UI events are dispatched through a central event bus.

4. **Factory Pattern**: For creating the appropriate LLM provider.

5. **Strategy Pattern**: Different LLM providers implementing a common interface.

6. **Command Pattern**: For internal commands.

7. **Observer Pattern**: The UI bus allows components to subscribe to events.

8. **Repository Pattern**: For session storage and retrieval.

## Error Handling Strategy

The codebase follows the provided guidelines:

1. **UI Layer**: Tolerant of errors, using fallbacks and graceful degradation.
   
2. **Core Components**: Fail-fast with assertions and strict validation.
   
3. **Natural Language/Unstructured Parsing**: Selectively tolerant with fallback strategies.
   
4. **Third-Party Integrations**: Balanced approach with retry mechanisms for transient errors.

## Logging Practices

- Module-level loggers are used consistently (`get_logger(__name__)`)
- Extra parameters are passed to defer string formatting
- Exception logging uses `logger.exception()`
- Structured logging with context information

## Code Style

- Type annotations throughout the codebase
- Comprehensive docstrings with imperative mood
- Constants instead of magic values
- Consistent use of double quotes
- Clean error messages with assigned variables

## Workflow

The core workflow is:

1. User enters a prompt
2. If it's a command (starting with `/`), process it internally
3. Otherwise, send it to the LLM with appropriate tools
4. LLM processes the prompt and may call one or more tools
5. Results from tool calls are sent back to the LLM
6. LLM generates a final response
7. Response is displayed to the user
8. Session is updated and persisted

The system is designed to be resilient to errors, with retry mechanisms for LLM calls and comprehensive error handling throughout.

## Compliance with Coding Rules

The code follows the specified rules:

1. **UI Layer**: Gracefully handles malformed inputs
2. **Core/Internal Components**: Uses assertions and fails fast on invalid states  
3. **Natural Language Parsing**: Shows appropriate tolerance with fallbacks
4. **Third-Party Integrations**: Balances fail-fast and tolerance based on API guarantees

Overall, StreetRaceðŸš—ðŸ’¨ follows a robust, well-architected design that adheres to software engineering best practices and provides a flexible, maintainable codebase ready for future extensions.

# Progress Assessment for CLI Command Safety Implementation

Based on the initial exploration of the project structure, I've identified the main components of the StreetRaceðŸš—ðŸ’¨ project. So far, I've only examined the directory structure to understand where our implementation should be placed. 

## Current Understanding
- The project follows a well-organized structure with clear separation of concerns
- There's a dedicated `tools` directory at `src/streetrace/tools/` which likely contains the CLI execution functionality we need to enhance with safety features
- The project appears to be a Python-based application using Poetry for dependency management

## Next Steps Needed
1. Examine the existing CLI tool implementation to understand how commands are currently executed
2. Look at any existing safety measures already in place
3. Design and implement the three-level safety categorization system (safe, ambiguous, risky)
4. Create the new safety module with proper parsing and analysis
5. Integrate the safety checks with the existing command execution flow
6. Write comprehensive tests for the new functionality

I haven't yet looked at the specific implementation of the CLI tools, which is necessary before proceeding with the implementation. I need to explore the existing code in the `src/streetrace/tools/` directory to understand how CLI commands are currently handled.

Take a look at @src/streetrace/ui/ui_bus.py and @src/streetrace/ui/console_ui.py.

Treat this as a single UI module.

Analyze the module from the project goals perspective, understand why the module is
essential to this project, describe the module's goal and function. Analyze third-party
dependencies and why they are used. If there are public classes, analyze if they are
created in @src/streetrace/app.py or @src/streetrace/main.py, and what other core
components depend on it.

Add or update this component's description in ./COMPONENTS.md following this structure:

```
# APP_NAME Components Overview

## ./workflow/supervisor.py

One line description: how this module contributes to the project goal.

More details, covering concise function description, lifecycle, and third-party
dependencies.
```

## Assistant

Now I'll provide a summary of my analysis of the UI module:

# UI Module Analysis for StreetRaceðŸš—ðŸ’¨

## Module Purpose and Goals

The UI module in StreetRaceðŸš—ðŸ’¨ serves as the interactive layer between the user and the AI assistant. It consists of two main components:

1. **UiBus (src/streetrace/ui/ui_bus.py)**: Implements a publish-subscribe pattern to decouple UI rendering from application logic, allowing components to communicate through standardized events.

2. **ConsoleUI (src/streetrace/ui/console_ui.py)**: Provides the terminal-based user interface with rich text rendering, interactive prompts, and real-time feedback.

## Why the Module is Essential

This module is critical to the project because:

1. It enables direct user interaction with the AI assistant through a command-line interface
2. It provides real-time feedback on token usage and costs during AI interactions
3. It offers advanced features like command completion and multiline input for complex coding scenarios
4. It decouples the UI layer from business logic, allowing for more maintainable and testable code

## Key Third-Party Dependencies

The UI module leverages several key third-party libraries:

1. **prompt_toolkit**: Provides advanced command-line interface features including:
   - Command history
   - Auto-completion
   - Multiline input support
   - Custom key bindings

2. **rich**: Enables rich text formatting in the terminal including:
   - Colored output
   - Status spinners for visual feedback
   - Structured text layout

3. **pubsub**: A simple publish-subscribe library used to implement the event bus pattern for UI updates

## Integration with Core Components

From analyzing `app.py` and `main.py`, I can see that:

1. The `ConsoleUI` and `UiBus` are created early in the application initialization process in `create_app()` function
2. The `UiBus` is injected into various components to allow them to send UI updates
3. The `Application` class orchestrates the interaction between UI and other components
4. Components like `workflow_supervisor` and `command_executor` use the UI bus to communicate with the UI

## Component Lifecycle

1. The `UiBus` is instantiated first in `create_app()`
2. The `ConsoleUI` is created with a reference to the `UiBus` and subscribed to UI update events
3. Other components receive the `UiBus` through dependency injection
4. During application runtime, components dispatch events to the bus, which routes them to appropriate subscribers
5. The `ConsoleUI` handles the main input loop in either interactive or non-interactive mode

The documentation in COMPONENTS.md has been updated to reflect this analysis.

## Analysis of CommandExecutor Module

Based on my analysis of the `CommandExecutor` module, here's a summary of its role in the StreetRace project:

### Purpose and Function

The `CommandExecutor` implements the command pattern for StreetRace, providing a centralized registry and execution mechanism for all application-specific commands. These commands are identified by a leading '/' character in user input (e.g., "/help", "/exit").

Key responsibilities include:
1. **Command Registration**: Maintains a registry of Command implementations
2. **Command Parsing**: Identifies and extracts command names from user input
3. **Command Execution**: Handles the asynchronous execution of commands with proper error handling
4. **Command Discovery**: Provides access to the list of available commands for auto-completion and help documentation

### Integration with Core Components

Looking at the `app.py` code, the `CommandExecutor` is:
- Created early in the application lifecycle
- Used by `Application` to process user inputs before they're sent to the AI agent
- Connected to the UI layer through the `CommandCompleter` for command auto-completion
- Extended with command implementations like `ExitCommand`, `HistoryCommand`, `CompactCommand`, `ResetSessionCommand`, and `HelpCommand`

### Role in Project Architecture

The `CommandExecutor` plays a critical role in:
1. **Separating Concerns**: It decouples command handling from the main application flow
2. **Extensibility**: New commands can be added without modifying core application logic
3. **User Experience**: Provides a consistent interface for users to execute application-specific functions

### Design Approach

The module follows good software engineering practices:
- **Fail-Fast Approach**: Commands are validated at registration time
- **Clear Error Handling**: Command execution failures are captured and reported back
- **Immutable Command Access**: Commands can only be accessed in an immutable way via the `commands` property
- **Clear Status Reporting**: The `CommandStatus` provides structured feedback on command execution

### Documentation Updates

I've made the following changes:
1. Added a new section to `COMPONENTS.md` describing the `CommandExecutor` module
2. Updated the module docstring to provide a more precise description of its purpose and function

These updates should help other developers understand how the `CommandExecutor` fits into the StreetRace architecture and its importance in enabling user interaction with the application through commands.

# Analysis of StreetRace's LLM Interface Components

I've completed the analysis of the LLM interface components in the StreetRace project. Here's a summary of my findings and the changes I've made:

## Component Analysis

### llm_interface.py

This module provides a standardized interface for all language model interactions in the StreetRace application. It acts as a critical abstraction layer that decouples the rest of the application from specific LLM provider implementations. Key aspects include:

1. **Abstraction Layer**: The `LlmInterface` abstract base class defines a common contract for all LLM implementations, enabling dependency inversion.

2. **Factory Pattern**: The `get_llm_interface` function creates the appropriate implementation based on the specified model.

3. **Token Estimation**: Provides functionality to estimate token count before sending prompts to LLMs, helping with cost monitoring.

4. **Error Handling**: Standardizes error reporting through the UiBus to ensure consistent user feedback.

The module relies on litellm for token counting and model interactions, making it compatible with multiple AI providers.

### lite_llm_client.py

This module enhances Google ADK's LiteLLM implementation with robust error handling, retry mechanisms, and usage tracking:

1. **Retry Mechanism**: `RetryingLiteLlm` implements tenacity-based retries with exponential backoff to handle transient errors like rate limits.

2. **Usage Tracking**: `LiteLLMClientWithUsage` captures token usage statistics and calculates costs, publishing this data through the UiBus.

3. **Error Handling**: Provides detailed error reporting and graceful degradation during service disruptions.

4. **Performance Optimization**: Balances between streaming and non-streaming modes based on the use case.

## Integration with Core Components

These LLM interface components are critical to the application as they:

1. Are instantiated in `app.py` through the `get_llm_interface` factory function
2. Are injected into the `Supervisor` workflow component
3. Enable the ReAct agent pattern for tool usage with AI models
4. Provide standardized access to multiple AI providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama)
5. Track token usage and costs for user feedback and monitoring

## Changes Made

1. **Updated COMPONENTS.md**: Added detailed descriptions for both LLM interface components, explaining their purpose, functionality, and integration with the rest of the application.

2. **Enhanced Module Docstrings**: Updated the docstrings in both modules to provide clearer descriptions of their purpose and functionality:
   - `llm_interface.py`: "Provides a standardized interface for all LLM providers used by StreetRaceðŸš—ðŸ’¨"
   - `lite_llm_client.py`: "Implements resilient LLM clients with retry, usage tracking, and cost calculation capabilities"

These changes improve the documentation of the codebase, making it easier for developers to understand the purpose and functionality of these critical components.

Now I'll provide a summary of my analysis and the changes made:

# Summary of Analysis and Changes

## Module Analysis

I analyzed three key tool modules in the StreetRace project:

1. **fs_tool.py**: Provides file system operations for AI agents to safely interact with local files. It acts as a facade for underlying implementation details, providing a clean interface for file reading, writing, directory listing, and content searching. All operations are constrained to the working directory for security.

2. **cli_tool.py**: Enables AI agents to execute CLI commands in a controlled environment. It's a simple wrapper around the implementation in the definitions directory, maintaining a clean interface while delegating security checks to cli_safety.py.

3. **cli_safety.py**: Implements a robust security layer for analyzing and classifying CLI command safety. It uses bashlex to parse commands and applies heuristics to determine if commands are safe, ambiguous, or risky based on command name, arguments, and path usage.

## Integration with Core Components

These tool modules are central to the project's functionality:

- They are wrapped by the **ToolProvider** class, which is instantiated in app.py and provides tools to AI agents through the Google ADK tool interface.
- The **Supervisor** class uses these tools to enable agent capabilities, allowing them to interact with the local file system and execute commands.
- Security mechanisms in cli_safety.py are crucial for maintaining a sandboxed environment for AI agent operations.

## Third-Party Dependencies

Key dependencies include:
- **bashlex**: Used for parsing and analyzing command structure in cli_safety.py
- **Google ADK**: The Agent Development Kit that forms the foundation for tool integration

## Changes Made

1. **Updated COMPONENTS.md**: Added comprehensive descriptions for each tool module, explaining their purpose, functionality, and integration with the broader system.

2. **Enhanced Module Docstrings**: Updated the docstrings for each module to provide clearer descriptions of their purpose and role in the system.

These changes improve documentation quality and provide better context for developers working with these modules, making it easier to understand how they fit into the overall architecture of the StreetRace project.

## Assistant

Great! The code now passes the ruff check. Let me provide a summary of the changes I made:

## Analysis of `src/streetrace/ui/completer.py`

### Module Purpose and Goal
The `completer.py` module is an essential component of the StreetRace UI system that enhances user experience by providing intelligent auto-completion in the console interface. It enables users to:

1. Quickly reference project files with `@` mentions (e.g., `@src/streetrace/ui/completer.py`)
2. Discover and use available commands with `/` prefix (e.g., `/help`, `/exit`, etc.)

This functionality reduces cognitive load and improves productivity by eliminating the need to remember or type exact file paths and command names.

### Core Components

The module implements three key classes:

1. **PathCompleter**: Handles file and directory path completion, supporting complex path scenarios including subdirectories and parent directory references.
2. **CommandCompleter**: Provides suggestions for available commands from the CommandExecutor.
3. **PromptCompleter**: A composite completer that delegates completion requests to the appropriate specialized completers.

### Dependencies

- **prompt_toolkit**: The module depends on the `prompt_toolkit` library for its completion interfaces (Completer, Completion, Document, CompleteEvent). This library is a key foundation for building sophisticated interactive command-line applications.
- **CommandExecutor**: Used by the CommandCompleter to get available commands, creating a dependency on the command system.

### Integration Points

In `app.py`, the completer components are instantiated in this order:
1. First, the CommandExecutor is created
2. Then the specialized completers (PathCompleter, CommandCompleter) are created
3. Next, these are composed into the PromptCompleter
4. Finally, the PromptCompleter is injected into the ConsoleUI

This demonstrates the module's key role in the application initialization process, as it must be set up early to enable the interactive console experience.

### Changes Made

1. Updated the module docstring to clearly explain its purpose, components, and benefits
2. Added the module description to COMPONENTS.md to document its role in the project architecture
3. Ensured code complies with the project's style guidelines by running `ruff`

These changes improve documentation and maintainability by providing clear explanations of the module's purpose and function within the larger StreetRace application.

Great! Let me summarize the changes I've made:

# Summary of Changes

I've analyzed the utility modules in the StreetRaceðŸš—ðŸ’¨ project and enhanced their documentation to better explain their purpose and integration with the overall application.

## Goal of the Changes

The primary goal was to:
1. Document the utility modules and their role in the StreetRace application architecture
2. Enhance module docstrings to better explain their purpose and functionality
3. Add comprehensive descriptions to the COMPONENTS.md file to help developers understand how these utilities fit into the larger system

## Modules Analyzed

I analyzed two key utility modules:

### 1. `utils/hide_args.py`
This module provides a decorator that modifies function signatures to hide specific parameters while automatically injecting them when the function is called. It's a critical part of the tool architecture in StreetRace, ensuring that:

- Tool functions have clean interfaces for AI agents
- Internal implementation details (like working directory) are hidden from the API surface
- Documentation is automatically adjusted to match the modified signatures

It's used extensively in the ToolProvider to hide the working directory parameter from tool functions, enabling a consistent working context without exposing this detail to the AI agent.

### 2. `utils/uid.py`
This module provides user identification functionality through a layered fallback approach:

- Attempts to get GitHub login via GitHub CLI
- Falls back to Git user.name configuration
- Uses OS username as a final fallback

This reliable user identification is essential for session management in StreetRace, allowing the application to consistently identify users across different environments and maintain appropriate conversation history.

## Changes Made

1. Added detailed descriptions of both utility modules to COMPONENTS.md
2. Enhanced the package-level docstring in `utils/__init__.py` to provide an overview of the included utilities
3. Improved docstrings in both utility modules to better explain their purpose and functionality
4. Fixed linting issues to ensure code quality standards are met

These changes ensure that developers new to the project can better understand the purpose and implementation of these utility modules and how they fit into the overall architecture of StreetRace.


# Mon May 26 10:51:43 2025 -0700

## User

Let's create a way to add more agents.

General requirements:

1. Agents can be created in the ./agents folder relative to the current folder, or in the ../../agents folder relative to the src/streetrace/app.py file.
2. Each agent is located in it's own subfolder, for example `./agents/software_engineer`.
3. An agent consists of:
   * agent.py - the main script that defines the agent using Google ADK.
   * agent.py exports one function: `run_agent(input: str)`
   * agent.py has a main function so it can run independently
   * README.md - a detailed description of the agent.
4. When the app starts (@src/streetrace/app.py), it uses a new discover_agents module (put it under src/streetrace/) to discover all existing agents and creates a list of agents, passing it to Supervisor's `run_async` so the supervisor knows what agents are available.

Analyze the requirements and come up with a final solution. Review and critique the solution as a third-party AI automation engineer, and provide the final merged solution. Only provide the solution, wait before starting to implement so I review the solution.
   

## Assistant

I'll analyze the requirements for implementing an agent discovery system in the StreetRace project. Let's design a comprehensive solution for discovering and using agents.

# Agent Discovery System Design

## Overview

We need to create a mechanism to discover and register agents dynamically from specific locations. These agents will be Python modules following a standardized structure and interface.

## Requirements Analysis

1. Agents will be located in:
   - `./agents/` (relative to current working directory)
   - `../../agents/` (relative to src/streetrace/app.py)

2. Each agent needs:
   - Its own subfolder (e.g., `./agents/software_engineer/`)
   - An `agent.py` file with a `run_agent(input: str)` function and a main entry point
   - A `README.md` with agent documentation

3. The application should discover all available agents on startup and pass them to the Supervisor

## Proposed Solution

I'll create a modular system with these components:

1. **Agent Interface**: Define a standard interface all agents must implement
2. **Agent Discovery Module**: Scan directories for valid agents
3. **Agent Registry**: Store discovered agents for use by the Supervisor
4. **Integration with Supervisor**: Pass registered agents to the Supervisor

### Component Details

#### 1. Agent Interface

We'll define a standardized interface for all agents to ensure consistency.

#### 2. Agent Discovery Module (`src/streetrace/discover_agents.py`)

This module will:
- Scan both agent directories
- Validate each potential agent directory
- Import and verify `agent.py` for required functionality
- Create agent metadata records

#### 3. Agent Registry

Store discovered agents with metadata like:
- Name (derived from directory name)
- Description (extracted from README.md)
- Path to agent module
- Reference to run_agent function

#### 4. Supervisor Integration

Update the Supervisor class to:
- Accept a list of available agents
- Provide mechanism to select and use specific agents

## Implementation Approach

The approach balances flexibility with reliability:

1. **Loose Coupling**: The agent discovery is separate from agent execution
2. **Validation**: We'll verify agents meet requirements before registering them
3. **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle invalid agent modules with clear error messages
4. **Documentation**: Thorough documentation for creating new agents

## Review and Critique

### Strengths
- Modular design separates discovery from execution
- Validation ensures only compatible agents are registered
- Dynamic discovery enables easy extensibility

### Potential Issues
- Error handling for malformed agents needs careful consideration
- Performance impact of dynamic imports should be monitored
- Need to ensure security measures for executing code from potentially untrusted agents

### Improvements
- Add agent versioning to handle compatibility
- Consider a more formal plugin architecture for future expansion
- Add telemetry to track agent performance and usage

## Final Solution Approach

I recommend implementing the solution with:

1. A dedicated `AgentInterface` class/protocol
2. A thorough discovery module with robust validation
3. Clear error messages for developers creating new agents
4. Agent metadata including capabilities and requirements
5. Documentation templates for new agent creation

This design balances the requirements for flexibility, reliability, and maintainability.


# Mon May 26 11:08:25 2025 -0700

## User

Let's also create a new tool called list_agents in src/streetrace/tools to discover the agents. We will pass this tool to the root agent so it can discover agents on its own. 
Let's also create another tool called list_tools that will list tools that can be provided to agents. For now, it can return a stub with a fake `run_agent` tool.

## Assistant

Perfect! Let's summarize the changes we've made:

# Summary of Changes: Agent Tools Implementation

## Goal of the Change
To implement an agent discovery system that allows the StreetRace assistant to discover and interact with specialized agents. The system provides two new tools:
1. `list_agents`: Discovers available agents in standard locations
2. `list_tools`: Lists tools that can be provided to agents

## User Scenarios Addressed
1. **Agent Discovery**: Users can now ask StreetRace to list available specialized agents
2. **Tool Exploration**: Users can inquire about what tools are available to agents
3. **Agent Assistance**: Users can eventually run specialized agents for specific tasks through StreetRace

## Implementation Details

### New Files Created:

1. **`src/streetrace/tools/definitions/list_agents.py`**
   - Implements a tool that discovers agents in standard locations
   - Validates that discovered agents have the required structure
   - Extracts metadata like descriptions from agent READMEs
   - Handles error conditions gracefully

2. **`src/streetrace/tools/definitions/list_tools.py`**
   - Lists available tools with their descriptions
   - Classifies tools based on whether they require agent capabilities
   - Provides a static list for now, but designed for future extensibility

3. **`src/streetrace/tools/agent_tools.py`**
   - Provides wrapper functions for the agent discovery tools
   - Exposes the tools with standardized interfaces
   - Integrates with the existing tool provider system

### Modified Files:

1. **`src/streetrace/workflow/supervisor.py`**
   - Added the new agent tools to the list of required tools
   - Ensures the root agent can discover and potentially interact with other agents

2. **`COMPONENTS.md`**
   - Added detailed documentation for the new agent_tools.py component
   - Explained how it fits into the overall system architecture

3. **`README.md`**
   - Added a new section explaining the agent tools functionality
   - Documented the requirements for creating custom agents
   - Described the locations where agents are discovered

## Key Features of the Implementation

1. **Security**: Strict validation of agent directories and files
2. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing or malformed agents
3. **Documentation**: Comprehensive docstrings and updated project documentation
4. **Type Safety**: Full type annotations throughout the implementation
5. **Code Quality**: Passes all ruff linting checks

## Future Extensions

1. The implementation lays groundwork for implementing a `run_agent` tool
2. The agent discovery mechanism can be extended to support different agent types
3. Tool discovery can be made dynamic rather than static

This implementation enables a hierarchical agent architecture where StreetRace can serve as a "supervisor" agent that discovers and potentially delegates to specialized agents for specific tasks.

## User

That looks great, thank you! Let's also assume each agent exports a get_agent_metadata function that returns the necessary metadata, like name and description. Let's import that functioon in `get_agent_description` and provide name and description from the metadata.

The `discover_agents` then will immediately try to load the metadata instead of using `is_valid_agent_directory`, and if the import succeeded - provide the agent info.

Let's also upgrade the `list_tools` function to provide a list of available tools from a local config file. It has to read tools.yaml from the ./tools folder relative to the current folder, or in the `../../tools` folder relative to the src/streetrace/app.py file.

Please create an initial ./tools/tools.yaml listing the existing tools. Each tool in the yaml has to define where to load the tool from. For each tool, the config will define the source to load from (e.g. 'local' for python modules, or 'mcp' for tools loaded from MCP). For 'local' tools, it provides a full python module name to import from, for 'mcp' tools - a name of the MCP server that provides the tool.

Please also create one sample "Hello World" agent example in the ./agents directory. Only implement stubs for `run_agent` and `agent_metadata`.

Lastly, please implement unit tests for:

* list_agents tool
* list_tools tool

## Assistant

Great! All tests are now passing. 

Let's summarize what we've accomplished:

# Summary of Changes: Agent Discovery System Implementation

## Goal of the Change
We've implemented a dynamic agent discovery system that allows StreetRace to find and utilize specialized agents. The system provides mechanisms to discover agents, extract their metadata, and list available tools.

## User Scenarios Addressed
1. **Agent Discovery**: Users can now discover and utilize specialized agents
2. **Tool Configuration**: Tools are now configurable via YAML, making it easy to add or modify available tools
3. **Extensibility**: The framework enables creating and adding new specialized agents

## Implementation Details

### Modified Files:

1. **`src/streetrace/tools/definitions/list_agents.py`**
   - Enhanced to import and validate agent modules
   - Added metadata extraction from `get_agent_metadata()` function
   - Implemented robust error handling for various failure scenarios
   - Added structured agent information including name, path, and description

2. **`src/streetrace/tools/definitions/list_tools.py`**
   - Updated to load tool definitions from YAML configuration files
   - Added fallback to default tools if configuration can't be loaded
   - Implemented detailed error handling and logging

3. **`COMPONENTS.md`**
   - Updated to document the agent_tools module capabilities
   - Added information about configuration-based tool loading

4. **`README.md`**
   - Added comprehensive documentation on the agent system
   - Provided instructions for creating custom agents
   - Documented the agent discovery process

### New Files:

1. **`./agents/hello_world/agent.py`**
   - Created a sample agent implementation
   - Implemented required interface methods: `get_agent_metadata()` and `run_agent()`

2. **`./agents/hello_world/README.md`**
   - Added documentation for the sample agent

3. **`./tools/tools.yaml`**
   - Created tool configuration defining available tools
   - Specified source type, module, and function for each tool

4. **`./agents/agent_schema.yaml`**
   - Defined schema for agent structure validation
   - Documented required files and functions

5. **`./tests/unit/tools/definitions/test_list_agents.py`**
   - Implemented comprehensive unit tests for agent discovery functionality

6. **`./tests/unit/tools/definitions/test_list_tools.py`**
   - Implemented unit tests for tool discovery and configuration loading

## Key Features

1. **Dynamic Discovery**: The system automatically discovers agents in standard locations
2. **Metadata Extraction**: Gets agent information from standardized metadata functions
3. **Configuration-Based Tools**: Tools are defined in YAML for easy maintenance
4. **Robust Error Handling**: Gracefully handles missing or malformed agents
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Full unit test coverage for new functionality

This implementation provides a solid foundation for a modular agent ecosystem within StreetRace, allowing for specialized agents to handle specific tasks while maintaining a consistent interface.
