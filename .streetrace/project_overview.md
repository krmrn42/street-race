# StreetRaceðŸš—ðŸ’¨ Project Overview

## Project Goal

StreetRaceðŸš—ðŸ’¨ is an agentic AI coding partner designed to help engineers leverage AI capabilities directly from the command line to create software. It serves as a bridge between AI language models and local file systems, allowing AI to assist with coding tasks by reading, writing, and manipulating files in a local development environment.

The primary goal is to create a seamless experience where developers can interact with an AI assistant that has access to necessary file system operations, enabling it to help write, modify, and debug code in real-time from the command line.

## Core Functionality

- Provides a set of tools for AI models to interact with the file system (read/write files, list directories)
- Uses litellm to standardize interactions with multiple AI providers
- Executes CLI commands with interactive capabilities (allowing real-time input/output)
- Searches for text within files using glob patterns
- Supports multiple AI backends including Anthropic, Gemini, OpenAI, and locally-hosted models via Ollama
- Offers both interactive and non-interactive command-line interfaces
- Provides internal commands for session control (e.g., `exit`, `quit`, `history`) # <-- Added history

## Project Structure

See COMPONENTS.md in repository rooot for core components structure.

## Integration

StreetRaceðŸš—ðŸ’¨ works with multiple AI providers:

- Anthropic's Anthropic (via `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`)
- Google's Gemini (via `GEMINI_API_KEY`)
- OpenAI models (via `OPENAI_API_KEY`)
- Open-source models via Ollama (local or remote)

The architecture (`src/streetrace/llm`) allows for easy switching between providers based on available API keys or specific needs for different tasks.

## Usage Scenarios

- Code generation and modification
- Project exploration and understanding
- Code search and refactoring
- Script execution and debugging
- Documentation generation

StreetRaceðŸš—ðŸ’¨ bridges the gap between powerful AI language models and local development environments, making it easier for developers to leverage AI assistance in their daily workflow.
