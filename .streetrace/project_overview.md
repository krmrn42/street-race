# Str33tRaceðŸš—ðŸ’¨ Project Overview

## Project Goal
StreetRaceðŸš—ðŸ’¨ is an agentic AI coding partner designed to help engineers leverage AI capabilities directly from the command line to create software. It serves as a bridge between AI language models and local file systems, allowing AI to assist with coding tasks by reading, writing, and manipulating files in a local development environment.

The primary goal is to create a seamless experience where developers can interact with an AI assistant that has access to necessary file system operations, enabling it to help write, modify, and debug code in real-time from the command line.

## Core Functionality
- Provides a set of tools for AI models to interact with the file system (read/write files, list directories)
- Executes CLI commands with interactive capabilities (allowing real-time input/output)
- Searches for text within files using glob patterns
- Supports multiple AI backends including Anthropic, Gemini, OpenAI, and locally-hosted models via Ollama
- Offers both interactive and non-interactive command-line interfaces

## Project Structure

This is a python app with the source code in `src/streetrace/`, tests in `tests/` directory, and docs in `docs/` directory.

The app is published in pypi and is can be used as a CLI to interact with LLMs using tools.

StreetRaceðŸš—ðŸ’¨ supports Gemini, Anthropic, and OpenAI, and Ollama as backends which are implemented in `src/streetrace/llm/`.
All LLM APIs implement LLMAPI interface defined in `llmapi.py` and have corresponding converters that implement
HistoryConverter interface defined in `history_converter.py`.

StreetRaceðŸš—ðŸ’¨ has a console UI implemented in `src/streetrace/ui/`.

The UI supports commands implemented in `src/streetrace/commands/`.

StreetRaceðŸš—ðŸ’¨ supports command line arguments described in `main.py`.

`examples/` Contains example scripts demonstrating programmatic usage.

`.streetrace` directory contains StreetRaceðŸš—ðŸ’¨ context and configuration files and rules that need to be followed by LLMs at all times, including this file. These files are not part of the core application structure.

## Integration

StreetRace works with multiple AI providers:

- Anthropic's Anthropic (via `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`)
- Google's Gemini (via `GEMINI_API_KEY`)
- OpenAI models (via `OPENAI_API_KEY`)
- Open-source models via Ollama (local or remote)

The architecture (`src/streetrace/llm`) allows for easy switching between providers based on available API keys or specific needs for different tasks.

## Usage Scenarios

- Code generation and modification
- Project exploration and understanding
- Code search and refactoring
- Script execution and debugging
- Documentation generation

StreetRace bridges the gap between powerful AI language models and local development environments, making it easier for developers to leverage AI assistance in their daily workflow.
