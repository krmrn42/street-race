  "summary": "The proposal outlines an improved architecture for AI code reviews, focusing on per-file reviews for enhanced scalability, quality, and operational benefits. The new system addresses existing limitations such as token window constraints and content truncation, offering scalable and reliable code review processes.",

      "title": "Potential High API Costs",
      "message": "Switching to per-file reviews may increase API costs significantly, which should be monitored and budgeted accordingly.",
      "category": "performance",
      "code_snippet": "Current: 1 API call with ~30K tokens = ~$0.30\nProposed: 34 files \u00d7 ~3K tokens each = 34 calls \u00d7 ~$0.03 = ~$1.02"

  "positive_feedback": [
    "The architecture allows for unlimited scalability without token limits, enabling effective reviews of large PRs with many files.",
    "The new system provides consistent quality by dedicating full AI focus to each individual file.",
    "Error handling improvements ensure that a single file failure does not abort the entire review process, leading to more robust operations."
