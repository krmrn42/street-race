# Session Service Test Suite

This directory contains tests for the `session_service.py` module, which is responsible for managing conversation sessions in the StreetRace application.

## Test Structure

The test suite is organized into several files:

1. **conftest.py**: Contains fixtures used across all test files, including mock objects, sample sessions, and temporary file system setup.

2. **test_utils.py**: Tests for utility functions and classes, including:
   - `_session_id()` function
   - `DisplaySessionsList` model and its renderer

3. **test_json_session_serializer.py**: Tests for `JSONSessionSerializer` class, which handles serializing and deserializing session data to/from JSON files.

4. **test_json_session_service.py**: Tests for `JSONSessionService` class, which extends the ADK `InMemorySessionService` to add JSON file storage.

5. **test_session_manager.py**: Tests for the `SessionManager` class, which provides high-level session management functionality.

6. **test_integration.py**: Integration tests that verify the components work together correctly.

## Running the Tests

To run the tests, use the following command from the project root:

```bash
poetry run pytest tests/unit/session_service/
```

For verbose output:

```bash
poetry run pytest tests/unit/session_service/ -v
```

## Test Coverage

These tests cover:

- Session ID generation
- Session serialization and deserialization
- Session storage and retrieval
- Session event management
- Post-processing of session conversations
- Error handling
- Edge cases

The test suite follows best practices:
- Using appropriate fixtures for setup and teardown
- Mocking external dependencies
- Testing both happy path and error scenarios
- Using temporary files to avoid affecting the real file system
- Separating unit tests from integration tests
